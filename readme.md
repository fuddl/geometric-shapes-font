This is a font containing unicodes _geometric shapes_. That means [Geometric Shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Shapes) (Complete) and [Geometric Shapes Extended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Shapes_Extended) (not complete) and some characters which I consider to be geometric.

All symbols should be as simple as possible and should be consistent in style and size:

1. Shapes without explicid size (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE etc.) should be within the bounderies of 12тип12. Use [the BLACK SQUARE](svg/u25A0-BLACK SQUARE.svg) for reference.
2. Shapes without explicid line thickness (THIN, BOLD, HEAVY etc.) should have a line thickness of 1. Use [the WHITE SQUARE](svg/u25A1-WHITE SQUARE.svg) for reference.
